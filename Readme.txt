This package includes 3 important things:

1. A cython module using linked list to do a chaining mesh algorithm to do cross
correlations.

python setup.py bulid_ext --inplace

2. A nilcrun/milcarun python file to do some basics on data preprocessing.

3. A jackrun python file to do the error bars on cross correlations.
